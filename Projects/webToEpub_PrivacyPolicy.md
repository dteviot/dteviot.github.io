## Privacy Policy

### Executive Summary - (for EU Bureaucrats and others of limited intellect)
Using WebToEpub will not reduce your privacy.
More precisely, WebToEpub will give you exactly as much privacy as if you were browsing the Internet and saving the web pages you find to your local machine and WebToEpub was not present.

### Legal Boilerplate
I (David Teviotale) built the WebToEpub Chrome (and Firefox) plug-in as a open source, free app. It is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page informs users of the plugin of my policies with the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who uses WebToEpub.
If you choose to use WebToEpub, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.
WebToEpub does NOT collect any "Personal Information".  Where personal information is defined as things like:
1. Your Name
2. Your Email Address
3. Your Physical Address
4. Your Credit Card Number(s)
5. etc.

Obviously, as Personal information is not collected, it's also not used, stored or passed on to anyone.

Note, while WebToEpub does not obtain this information (or ask your for it), it is theoretically possible you could put this information into an EPUB it creates.  For example, you could tell WebToEpub to use your credit card number as the file name to save the EPUB as.  If you're doing stupid things like that.  STOP DOING THEM!

### Information Collection and Use
The whole purpose of WebToEpub is to obtain content from the Internet and write it to a local EPUB file.
Technically, this content counts as "information".  Therefore, this is the primary information that WebToEpub collects.
These EPUB files are stored on locally on your machine.  They are not sent anywhere else (unless you do that by some other mechanism.)  

In addition to the content, the EPUB file also contains the URL(s) the content came from. WebToEpub does not store or send these URLs anywhere else either.  
However, as WebToEpub is hosted inside a Web Browser (e.g. Chrome) WebToEpub has no control over what Chrome does with your URLs.
Of course, the Web Browser would be doing this anyway (if WebToEpub was not present.) If that concerns you, use Firefox.

In addition to the above, if you use the WebToEpub's Default Parser to process a site (and WebToEpub will tell you when it's doing that) WebToEpub records the site's host name. This is so it can configure the Default Browser should you want to create another EPUB from the site.
Note, this isn't that much different from the Web Browser recording your history.  If this is a concern, send me an email (see section "Contact Privacy Officer" below for contact details.)

### Log Data
WebToEpub does not have a log file.

### Cookies
Cookies are files with small amount of data that is commonly used an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

### Changes to Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. (Although it's pretty bloody unlikely. I've got better things to do with my time.) Anyway you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.

### Contact Privacy Officer
As per EU regulations, I'm required to have a Privacy Officer you can contact if you have privacy issues.
As I'm the only person working on this project, the Privacy Officer is myself.
If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, contact me at davidt@gmail.com and I'll address your concerns with the respect I think they deserve.
